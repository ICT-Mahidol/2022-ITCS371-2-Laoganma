# 2022-ITCS371-2-Laoganma

This project has been done under the scope of a Software development company which is the Digital Game Store System. All of the deliverables and presentation slides are included under the ```phase-1``` folder in the ```sec2_Laoganma_report.pdf```. Since the diagrams might be difficult to see on the report (e.g., too small), our team separately provides the .png file inside the folder with the explicit naming file.
